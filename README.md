Form Validation with AngularJS

HTML5 and AngularJS has been used to develop this project. It can run on any browser. You can take the whole folder in Sublime Text and
run it on any browser, it will do the following.

1. Have pre defined values for username and emailid. You need to enter values other then them if you wish to do so.
2. If any of the field is kept empty, the submit button would freeze up. Also if the format for email is not up to the mark then too, 
submit would freeze up.

It demonstates how AngularJS can be used to achieve the same.
